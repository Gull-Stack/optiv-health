          <p class="lead">Your employees have health insurance. They show up on your benefits enrollment reports. But when they get sick, they can't afford to use their coverage. Welcome to the <strong>rise of insured uninsured</strong> - the fastest-growing crisis in American healthcare.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What Are the Insured Uninsured?</h2>

        <p><strong>Insured uninsured solutions</strong> start with understanding the problem. The "insured uninsured" refers to employees who have health coverage but avoid using it due to cost barriers:</p>

        <div class="definition-box">
          <h3>The Insured Uninsured Definition</h3>
          <p>Employees with active health insurance who delay, skip, or ration medical care due to out-of-pocket costs, high deductibles, or coverage gaps.</p>
        </div>

        <p>This isn't a small problem. Recent studies show that <strong>28% of insured Americans</strong> have delayed medical care due to cost concerns. For your business, this means:</p>

        <ul class="impact-list">
          <li>Employees showing up to work sick (presenteeism)</li>
          <li>Minor health issues becoming major (and expensive) claims</li>
          <li>Higher absenteeism and lower productivity</li>
          <li>Increased turnover as employees seek better benefits</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Rise of Insured Uninsured: Why Now?</h2>

        <p>The <strong>hidden costs insured uninsured</strong> phenomenon didn't happen overnight. Several trends converged to create this crisis:</p>

        <h3>1. High-Deductible Health Plan Proliferation</h3>
        <div class="trend-card">
          <div class="trend-stat">87%</div>
          <div class="trend-desc">of employer plans now have deductibles over $1,000</div>
        </div>
        <p>What started as cost-control has become cost-shifting. Employees face $3,000-8,000+ deductibles before insurance kicks in.</p>

        <h3>2. Prescription Drug Cost Crisis</h3>
        <div class="trend-card">
          <div class="trend-stat">45%</div>
          <div class="trend-desc">of Americans skip prescribed medications due to cost</div>
        </div>
        <p>Even with insurance, prescription costs average $400+/month for chronic conditions.</p>

        <h3>3. Provider Network Restrictions</h3>
        <p>Narrow networks force employees to choose between convenience/quality and staying "in-network" to avoid massive bills.</p>

        <h3>4. Mental Health Access Barriers</h3>
        <p>Average wait times for mental health appointments: 48 days. Many employees simply give up.</p>
