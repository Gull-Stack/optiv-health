    <h1>Healthcare Benefits for Home Healthcare</h1>
    <p>Your caregivers take care of others. It's time to take care of them.</p>

        <h2>The Home Healthcare Staffing Crisis</h2>
        <p>Home healthcare agencies face a brutal reality: <strong>demand for caregivers is skyrocketing while the supply is shrinking</strong>. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 25% growth in home health aide positions through 2031 — far outpacing nearly every other occupation.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, turnover rates in home healthcare hover around 65-80% annually. The math doesn't work. You're constantly recruiting, training, and losing caregivers faster than you can replace them.</p>
        
        <h3>Benefits Drive Retention</h3>
        <p>Exit surveys tell the same story: caregivers leave for better benefits, not just better pay. A $1/hour raise might get someone's attention, but comprehensive health benefits — especially for part-time workers who rarely qualify — create genuine loyalty.</p>
        
        <p>The challenge? Traditional health insurance is expensive, and your margins are already tight.</p>
        
        <h3>The Optiv Health Solution</h3>
        <p>Our Section 125 supplemental health plan is designed for the realities of home healthcare:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Affordable for employers</strong> — Save $600-900/employee while offering better benefits</li>
          <li><strong>Valuable to employees</strong> — Free prescriptions and unlimited telehealth are tangible perks</li>
          <li><strong>Works for distributed teams</strong> — Caregivers access benefits from anywhere</li>
          <li><strong>Includes part-time workers</strong> — No minimum hours requirement</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Why Caregivers Love It</h3>

          <div class="benefit-item">
            <h4>💊 Free Prescriptions</h4>
            <p>Many caregivers skip their own medications to afford their patients' care. With 1,000+ free generics, that's no longer a choice they have to make.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-item">
            <h4>📱 Telehealth Anywhere</h4>
            <p>Your caregivers are on the road constantly. 24/7 telehealth means they can see a doctor between shifts, without driving to a clinic.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-item">
            <h4>💰 Higher Take-Home Pay</h4>
            <p>Pre-tax deductions mean more money in their pocket. For someone earning $15-20/hour, that extra $300-500/year matters.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-item">
            <h4>🏥 Preventive Care</h4>
            <p>Healthy caregivers provide better care. Easy access to healthcare keeps your workforce at peak performance.</p>
