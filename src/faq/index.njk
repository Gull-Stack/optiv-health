        <h2>About Section 125 Plans</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is a Section 125 plan?</h3>
          <p>A Section 125 plan (also called a "cafeteria plan") is an IRS-approved benefit program that allows employees to pay for certain qualified expenses using pre-tax dollars. This reduces taxable income for employees and payroll taxes for employers.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How does a Section 125 plan save money?</h3>
          <p>Employees save because their contributions come out before federal income tax, Social Security tax, and Medicare tax are calculated. Employers save 7.65% on every dollar contributed (the employer portion of FICA taxes).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What benefits can be included in a Section 125 plan?</h3>
          <p>Qualified benefits include health insurance premiums, dental and vision coverage, flexible spending accounts (medical and dependent care), disability insurance, life insurance (up to $50,000), and supplemental health plans like Optiv Health.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What's the minimum company size for a Section 125 plan?</h3>
          <p>There's no legal minimum, but Section 125 plans are most cost-effective for companies with 25+ employees. The administrative costs become negligible at that scale.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do Section 125 plans require a written document?</h3>
          <p>Yes. IRS regulations require a formal written plan document that describes the benefits offered, eligibility requirements, and election procedures. Optiv Health provides all necessary documentation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>About Optiv Health</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Does Optiv Health replace my current health insurance?</h3>
          <p>No. Optiv Health is a <strong>supplemental</strong> benefit that works alongside your existing major medical coverage. Employees keep their current health insurance while gaining additional benefits like free prescriptions and telehealth.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How much does Optiv Health cost employers?</h3>
          <p>Most employers actually <strong>save money</strong> with Optiv Health. The FICA tax savings and reduced claims costs typically exceed the plan costs, resulting in net savings of $600-900 per employee per year.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What's included in the Optiv Health supplemental plan?</h3>
          <p>Our plan includes: 1,000+ free generic prescriptions at $0 copay, unlimited 24/7 telehealth visits, pre-tax premium deductions, and preventive care support. All benefits are accessible from day one with no deductibles.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is there a long-term contract?</h3>
          <p>No. We don't lock employers into multi-year contracts. Our 98.4% renewal rate proves that clients stay because the product works, not because they're contractually obligated.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How long does implementation take?</h3>
